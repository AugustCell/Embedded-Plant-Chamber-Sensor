# Embedded-Plant-Chamber-Sensor
ESE381 final project *Embedded Systems II*. This is a Plant-Chamber-Sensor made in Embedded C, which controls an ATMega128 chip to control external sensors.

These sensors brought information back, such as humidity/temperature/current time to the ATMega chip.

The chip would display this on an LCD screen.

This was done using SPI protocols between sensors/ATMega128.
